scM&T-Seq
=========

Abstract
--------
We report scM&T–seq, a method for parallel single–cell genome–wide methylome and
transcriptome sequencing, allowing discovery of associations between
transcriptional and epigenetic variation. Profiling of 61 mouse embryonic stem
cells confirmed known links between DNA methylation and transcription. Notably,
the method reveals novel associations between heterogeneous methylation of
distal regulatory elements and transcriptional heterogeneity of key pluripotency
genes.
